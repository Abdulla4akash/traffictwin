# TrafficTwin Agent Instructions

Repository root: `diss/`

Canonical product specification: `docs/traffictwin-design-v0_7.md`

Before architectural work or implementation decisions, read the canonical specification completely. Treat it as the product and research specification, while keeping unconfirmed external integrations behind explicit capability interfaces.

The v0.7 specification is the approved future product design for Manchester historical/live
evidence, observed-to-SUMO calibration, SUMO-to-VEC research flow, and the task-oriented product
interface. Every `MAN-*`, `UX-*`, and `REL-01` capability begins planned; design inclusion does not
make it implemented. The immutable `v0.6.0` release remains the implemented reproducible baseline.
VEC-01 through VEC-12 have passed their recorded evidence gates, but this does not broaden any
residual scientific, licensing, hosting, canonicalisation, or generic-launch boundary. Use
`docs/implementation-status.md` for current truth.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- The guaranteed workflow is import-first.
- Direct Randy VEC/SUMO launch is conditional and must not be faked.
- Metrics must be computed by deterministic code.
- Diagnostic hypotheses must be produced by deterministic rules.
- An LLM, if added later, may only render already-computed findings into prose.
- Do not let an LLM calculate metrics, invent findings, or recommend unsupported actions.
- Do not fabricate Randy schemas, CSV fields, simulator capabilities, launch commands, live data, experimental results, paper claims, or performance numbers.
- Preserve raw inputs unchanged.
- Keep unsupported or unknown functionality visibly unavailable rather than silently simulated.
- Use synthetic fixtures only when clearly labelled synthetic.
- Keep the UI thin over tested library code.

## Project Records

As the project evolves, update:

- `docs/implementation-status.md`
- `docs/assumption-register.md`
- `docs/open-questions.md`
- `docs/architecture.md` when architecture decisions change

## v0.7 Work Coordination

### Completed parallel ownership: Claude UI presentation Phase 1

- Claude owns advisory presentation groundwork for `UX-01`–`UX-03` on
  `claude/ui-redesign`, forked from the first pushed lead v0.7 integration commit after
  `c2160999c6c66ab3b871b2ebd0ef6645a1ee6952` that records this grant. This grant does not accept a
  gate or permit any capability-status change.
- The exclusive Phase 1 file set is `.streamlit/config.toml`,
  `src/traffictwin/ui/theme.py`, `src/traffictwin/ui/tables.py`, every tracked source file under
  `src/traffictwin/ui/components/`, and new tests named
  `tests/unit/ui/test_components_*.py` or `tests/unit/ui/test_tables_display.py`.
- Existing public functions, imports, arguments, and return shapes in the claimed presentation
  modules must remain backward compatible because lead-owned in-flight pages consume them. New
  display models and helpers may be additive; removing or renaming an existing API requires a new
  lead review.
- Claude must not edit `src/traffictwin/ui/app.py`, either navigation module,
  `src/traffictwin/ui/manchester_operations.py`, any file under `src/traffictwin/ui/pages/`, any
  existing test outside the exact new-test allowance, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, integration or
  CLI code, shared project records, generated references, documentation indexes, changelog, or
  this `AGENTS.md` file.
- If the branch was created earlier, it must be rebased onto that pushed integration commit before
  work continues. Merge is conditional on focused component tests, existing UI tests, the full
  relevant unit suite, light- and dark-theme smoke checks, and lead review of the complete branch
  diff. Phase 2 page or navigation work requires a fresh disjointness check and a separate
  ownership grant.

Phase 1 was lead-reviewed and merged at `11eacb6`; the lead then removed the residual CSS injector
at `0da8175` so native Streamlit configuration is the only theme mechanism. The Phase 1 file claim
is closed. Later edits to those shared presentation files require a new grant.

### Completed parallel ownership: Claude UI presentation Phase 2A

- Claude owns the bounded `UX-01`–`UX-03` shell and first-impression presentation slice after
  fast-forwarding `claude/ui-redesign` to the latest `codex/traffictwin-v0.7`. This work remains
  presentation-only: it cannot accept a gate, change capability truth, fetch evidence, or compute
  scientific results.
- The exclusive Phase 2A source files are `src/traffictwin/ui/app.py`,
  `src/traffictwin/ui/navigation.py`, `src/traffictwin/ui/navigation_v07.py`, and exactly these page
  files: `src/traffictwin/ui/pages/home.py`, `src/traffictwin/ui/pages/run_overview.py`, and
  `src/traffictwin/ui/pages/evidence_readiness.py`.
- Claude may edit `tests/ui/test_navigation_v07.py` and `tests/ui/test_product_polish.py`, and may
  add tests named `tests/unit/ui/test_page_presentation_*.py`. The linked-worktree About regression
  test must remain intact. No other existing test file is transferred.
- Phase 2A must make grouped `st.navigation` the normal v0.7 route while preserving an explicit,
  tested compatibility path; remove duplicated shell copy; move raw dictionaries/JSON and full
  machine identifiers out of primary page content into clearly labelled Advanced/Evidence
  expanders; use numeric `st.metric` cards only; and apply the merged table/badge/fingerprint
  presentation helpers without changing the underlying values.
- Use native Streamlit APIs and `.streamlit/config.toml`: no custom HTML/CSS, no
  `unsafe_allow_html`, no deprecated `use_container_width`, no new dependency, and no scientific or
  acquisition logic in a page. Unavailable, stale, synthetic, historical, near-live, and
  live-vehicle evidence states must remain explicit and must never be hidden, combined, or filled
  with defaults.
- Claude must not edit `src/traffictwin/ui/pages/manchester_operations.py`,
  `src/traffictwin/ui/manchester_operations.py`, `src/traffictwin/ui/services.py`,
  `src/traffictwin/ui/page_runtime.py`, `src/traffictwin/ui/labels.py`, any `app_pages/` wrapper,
  any Phase 1 shared presentation file, integration/CLI code, dependencies, shared project records,
  generated references, documentation indexes, changelog, or this `AGENTS.md` file.
- Handoff requires focused tests, all `tests/ui`, all `tests/unit`, ruff, strict mypy on edited
  source, `git diff --check`, light/dark screenshots of the Home and one evidence-heavy page, and a
  complete list of residual raw dumps or presentation debt. Leave changes committed only on
  `claude/ui-redesign`; the lead owns final review, merge, capability reconciliation, and push.

#### Phase 2A closure amendment after lead review

- Before any Phase 2B page work, Claude must rebase `claude/ui-redesign` onto lead commit
  `e3a793765c7ab1a1edd15b7221700376b787b705` and close the 18 reproducible full-UI-suite failures
  caused by making grouped `st.navigation` the default. This is test migration, not a reason to
  restore the legacy router as the default.
- Claude may additionally edit exactly these existing tests:
  `tests/ui/test_analyst_annotations.py`, `tests/ui/test_executive_summary.py`,
  `tests/ui/test_experiment_planner.py`, `tests/ui/test_latex_exports.py`,
  `tests/ui/test_manifest_inference_services.py`, `tests/ui/test_measurement_imperfections.py`,
  `tests/ui/test_parameter_sweep.py`, `tests/ui/test_registry_search.py`,
  `tests/ui/test_report_diffing.py`, `tests/ui/test_scenario_mutation.py`,
  `tests/ui/test_sumo_services.py`, `tests/ui/test_tos_analysis_pages.py`, and
  `tests/ui/test_tos_services.py`. Migrate only navigation setup from `app.radio[0]` to the exact
  `AppTest.switch_page(page_script_for(UiPage...))` route; preserve the scientific and interaction
  assertions.
- In the already-owned `src/traffictwin/ui/pages/home.py`, replace the stale legacy statement that
  no live Manchester data is connected with the current source truth: live BODS evidence covers
  buses only, while general live/near-live Manchester road traffic remains unavailable. Do not
  imply that WebTRIS is near-live; the lead's new reassessment explicitly refuses that claim.
- Re-run all `tests/ui` with zero failures, all `tests/unit`, focused navigation/page tests, ruff,
  strict mypy, and `git diff --check`, and supply the required light/dark screenshots. Do not begin
  the proposed Phase 2B page/table harvest until the lead merges this closed Phase 2A branch and
  records a new file-level grant.

Phase 2A was lead-reviewed and merged at
`b4f4d39c66c9e10d9ce16c5ba232d09e51abfea3`. The lead then reconciled its Manchester evidence
copy against the accepted BODS and National Highways operational slices. The Phase 2A source and
test claim is closed; later edits require a new explicit grant.

### Active parallel ownership grant: Claude UI presentation Phase 2B Tier 1

- Claude owns the first bounded page-presentation harvest after fast-forwarding
  `claude/ui-redesign` to the pushed `codex/traffictwin-v0.7` HEAD that contains this grant. The
  work is presentation-only groundwork for `UX-01`–`UX-03`; it cannot accept a gate, change
  capability truth, fetch evidence, alter deterministic calculations, or edit source data.
- The exclusive source files are exactly
  `src/traffictwin/ui/pages/{helpers.py,sumo_import.py,bundle_import.py,compare.py,about.py,tos_data_import.py,experiment_manager.py}`.
  The shared helper may shorten a primary-display fingerprint only while retaining the complete
  value in an Advanced/Evidence surface. The six pages may adopt the existing badge, table,
  column-configuration, fingerprint, bordered-container, and numeric-metric presentation helpers.
- Claude may edit only these existing tests where a presentation assertion must follow the owned
  page: `tests/ui/test_product_polish.py`, `tests/ui/test_sumo_services.py`, and
  `tests/ui/test_tos_services.py`. Scientific, service, navigation, and interaction assertions
  must remain intact. Claude may add tests named
  `tests/unit/ui/test_page_presentation_tier1*.py`; no other existing test file is transferred.
- Primary content must use human labels, explicit units, native Streamlit tables/charts, numeric
  `st.metric` values, and concise evidence states. Raw dictionaries/JSON, complete fingerprints,
  machine IDs, and implementation metadata may move only to clearly labelled Advanced/Evidence
  expanders; unavailable, rejected, warning, stale, historical, synthetic, and live states must
  remain visible and exact. Hiding a display column must not be used as a privacy boundary.
- Do not edit `.streamlit/config.toml`, navigation/app files, `src/traffictwin/ui/labels.py`, any
  Manchester Operations file, Phase 1 shared components or `tables.py`, `vec_workbench.py`, any
  integration/service/CLI module, dependency file, project record, generated reference,
  documentation index, changelog, or this `AGENTS.md`. In particular,
  `client.showSidebarNavigation` is not part of this grant; the installed Streamlit contract says
  it controls legacy `pages/` auto-navigation, not the explicit `st.navigation` router.
- Handoff requires a clean branch, exact changed-file inventory, focused new/edited tests, all
  `tests/ui`, all `tests/unit`, repository Ruff, strict mypy, `git diff --check`, and light/dark
  screenshots of at least one import page and one comparison/metadata page. Leave commits only on
  `claude/ui-redesign`; the lead owns review, merge, shared records, capability reconciliation, and
  push. Phase 2B Tier 2 remains ungranted.

### Active lead ownership: MAN-05/MAN-08 live-bus completion slice

- The lead owns the identifier-only Bee Network verification/classification slice for `MAN-05`,
  its BODS live-scene integration, generated contract wiring, exact aggregate probe evidence,
  private snapshot retention, manual refresh coordination, aggregate live history, display-time
  stale fallback, lead-owned Manchester Operations wording, project records, and focused tests.
- Lead implementation files are limited to new `bee_network.py` library/tests/docs/evidence plus
  new `bods_retention.py` and `bods_live_control.py` library/tests/docs,
  `integration/manchester/__init__.py`, `bods_live.py`, the Manchester Operations service/page and
  their existing tests, the reference generator/output, and lead-owned status/index records.
  These files do not overlap Claude's Phase 1 presentation-layer grant.
- The slice may activate only exact `OperatorRef` values observed in accepted live-feed evidence;
  display names and geography remain prohibited membership tests. Unobserved candidates,
  non-matches, malformed rows, and out-of-scope rows remain explicitly accounted for, and public
  export remains unavailable.

### Active lead ownership: MAN-03/MAN-07 WebTRIS recency reassessment

- The lead owns the bounded 24 July 2026 WebTRIS real-source recency probe, the resulting
  machine-readable evidence and interpretation document, and reconciliation of the Manchester
  live-feature matrix and lead-owned project records. This reassessment may refine blockers but
  cannot promote WebTRIS historical observations to `near_live` or accept a `MAN-*` capability.
- The exclusive file set is
  `docs/integration/evidence/manchester_webtris_recency_probe_20260724.json`,
  `docs/integration/manchester_webtris_near_live_reassessment.md`,
  `docs/integration/manchester_live_feature_matrix.md`, `docs/implementation-status.md`,
  `docs/open-questions.md`, `docs/assumption-register.md`, `docs/index.md`, and this ownership
  record. The lead also owns the narrow HTTP-204 classification correction in
  `src/traffictwin/integration/manchester/transport.py` and
  `tests/unit/test_manchester_transport.py`. The work is disjoint from Claude's active Phase 2A
  UI claim.
- The older NTIS callback assumption was superseded on 24 July 2026 by direct tests of the current
  National Highways REST products. The new source boundary is owned and audited separately below;
  it must not be represented as WebTRIS evidence or as complete Manchester road telemetry.

### Active lead ownership: MAN-01/MAN-07/MAN-08 National Highways operations slice

- The lead owns the bounded current National Highways REST integration for Road and Lane Closures
  v2, Speed Managed Areas v1, and Digital VMS v1. This includes the Gate-A extension record,
  secret-header transport support, exact DATEX II JSON parsers, immutable private snapshots,
  offline replay, source-specific freshness/outage state, explicit Manchester-area envelope,
  aggregate refresh history, and separate Operations-map layers.
- The exclusive implementation files are new `national_highways*.py` modules and focused tests,
  `src/traffictwin/integration/manchester/{transport.py,freshness.py,spatial.py,map_layers.py,__init__.py}`,
  `src/traffictwin/ui/manchester_operations.py`,
  `src/traffictwin/ui/pages/manchester_operations.py`, focused Manchester Operations tests, and
  lead-owned design/audit/status/index/architecture/assumption/open-question records. These files
  remain disjoint from Claude's active Phase 2A grant.
- Authentication is a transient `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header only. No credential value may
  enter a model, URL, query, snapshot, receipt, scene, log, exception, test fixture, documentation,
  Git object, or rendered UI. The current 10-request-per-key-per-minute provider limit is enforced
  more conservatively by one explicit three-product refresh per minute; no background polling is
  introduced.
- The operational sources cover the Strategic Road Network only. Closures/incidents, imposed
  temporary speed restrictions, and displayed VMS messages remain three separate evidence kinds;
  they are never relabelled as measured traffic speed, traffic volume, congestion, or complete
  Manchester coverage. Capability state changes remain lead-reconciled after real-source evidence.

- Use `MAN-01`–`MAN-11`, `UX-01`–`UX-03`, `REL-01`, and Gates A–F from the v0.7 design as units of
  ownership. Record the capability and files owned before editing; agents sharing one checkout
  must use disjoint file sets.
- v0.7 Gate A is accepted in
  `docs/integration/manchester-source-gate-a-audit-v0_7.md` and ADR-054 through ADR-057. It is the
  serial prerequisite for source-specific schema, time/freshness, licence, publication, transport,
  and parser work. Agents may implement Gate B only against those frozen decisions and scoped
  blockers; documentation or a successful API response alone still does not accept an adapter or
  complete `MAN-01`.
- Acquisition, parsing, normalisation, map matching, calibration, comparison, and UI work must
  remain separate tested boundaries. Streamlit pages read accepted local snapshots through
  services and must not fetch external APIs or implement scientific formulas.
- Treat the v0.6 tag and valuable v0.6 workspaces as immutable. v0.7 compatibility is read-only and
  copy-on-write until `REL-01` passes migration, rollback, and side-by-side acceptance.
- Shared integration surfaces—CLI, capability manifests, generated references, navigation,
  changelog, documentation indexes, and project records—remain lead-owned merge files unless
  ownership is explicitly transferred.
- No agent may independently mark a v0.7 capability implemented. The integrating agent reconciles
  code, tests, real-source acceptance evidence, security/licence checks, UI acceptance, generated
  contracts, documentation, and capability truth.

## Preserved v0.6 Evidence Boundaries

- Use the v0.6 capability IDs and Gates A–G as the unit of ownership. Record the capability and
  files owned before editing; agents sharing one checkout must use disjoint file sets.
- v0.6 Gate A (`VEC-01`) is the serial prerequisite and is now accepted in
  `docs/integration/randy-source-snapshot-audit-v0_6.md` plus its generated machine record. No
  agent may implement a schema, mapping, join, or launcher from the email alone; use the pinned
  observed contract, limits, hashes, and blockers from that audit.
- After v0.6 Gate A, contract/fixture work (`VEC-02`), read-only identity/trip joins (`VEC-03`–`VEC-05`),
  and preprocessing/runner work (`VEC-06`–`VEC-08`) may proceed in separate worktrees or explicitly
  disjoint modules. `VEC-09` and `VEC-10` consume only accepted upstream artifacts; `VEC-11` is
  accepted through its permission-manifested pack, and `VEC-12` closes the final reconciliation
  gate with an offline-verifiable artifact.
- Gate C read-only joins (`VEC-03`–`VEC-05`), Gate D (`VEC-06`), the library-level `VEC-07` runner,
  the pinned-case `VEC-08` reproduction verifier, and Gate F scientific admission (`VEC-09`) are
  accepted. VEC-03 identities are valid only inside
  exact reconciled inclusive occupancy spans and a snapshot is bound to the complete trace
  fingerprint. `VEC-07` may consume only
  an exact Gate-A-reviewed trace or a trace identified by a completed, validated VEC-06 receipt; it
  must not bypass preflight or execute an arbitrary script/NPZ. VEC-08 establishes scoped numerical
  equivalence only for its recorded full weekend protocol-seed CPU case.
- VEC-09 admits only contract-compatible task/latency/decision/trip-duration metrics plus separately
  named TOS deadline-success, slot-tier, and no-target measures. It must keep physical completion,
  per-task energy, canonical infrastructure, confirmed-target, protected-attribute fairness, and
  occupancy-cohort trip completion unavailable. R1, R2, and R7 remain blocked; R6 is conditional
  and no threshold or finding was evaluated during admission.
- VEC-10 is accepted as a thin interface. Its VEC evaluator control is conditional on the exact
  request-specific VEC-07 preflight and foreground current-process execution. Do not add arbitrary
  commands, detached/background jobs, a persistent queue, training, dependency installation, or
  source mutation. Default generic/SUMO direct launch remains false.
- VEC-02 and VEC-11 are accepted together at Gate B/G: the exact observed contract is accompanied
  by the reviewed three-row pseudonymised/rounded `_s102` sample and VEC-09 aggregates. Never add
  raw IDs, identity mappings, clocks, targets, private paths, checkpoints, repositories, or
  third-party SUMO assets. Pseudonymisation is not anonymity; public hosting remains unauthorised
  until the project licence and every external publication basis are explicit.
- VEC-12 is accepted at the final Gate-G boundary. Its deterministic 27-member ZIP may embed only
  the allowlisted audit/software metadata and VEC-11 sanitised sample/aggregates. Preserve the
  VEC-08 protocol-seed versus VEC-09/VEC-11 `_s102` run distinction, complete limitations and
  exclusions, fixed ZIP metadata, checksums, offline verification, and new-only publication. Do
  not add raw external/execution bytes or strengthen licensing, hosting, anonymity, completion,
  energy, transfer, diagnostic, causal, scenario, or platform claims.
- Treat shared integration surfaces—`src/traffictwin/cli.py`, capability manifests, generated
  references, documentation indexes, changelog, and project records—as lead-owned merge files.
  Feature agents should expose tested library APIs first and leave final shared-surface wiring to
  the integrating agent unless ownership is explicitly transferred.
- External repositories under `../external/` are read-only evidence. One designated audit owner
  may synchronise them after confirming a clean state; no agent may edit, commit, clean, switch,
  merge, or push those repositories as part of TrafficTwin implementation.
- Each handoff must include exact source commits, inspected relative paths and hashes, changed
  files, tests run, residual blockers, and capability truth. Agents cannot independently mark a
  v0.6 capability implemented; the integrating agent reconciles code, tests, docs, generated
  references, and acceptance evidence first.
- Prefer separate branches/worktrees. If agents must share the current checkout, do not run broad
  formatters, generators, staging, commits, or cleanup while another agent owns overlapping files.

The historical `../XITS/` notes are preserved as research material. They are not active
implementation blockers for the approved TrafficTwin design.
